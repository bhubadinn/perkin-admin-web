In my previous response, I completed the provided React code snippet for a set of dashboard pages (UsersPage, AnalyticsPage, ProjectsPage, SettingsPage, ProfilePage, SecurityPage, and NotificationsPage). The original code you shared was truncated in the NotificationsPage component, specifically cutting off mid-way through rendering the notification items in the CardContent.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of what I did:

1. **Identified the Incomplete Section**: The code ended abruptly in the NotificationsPage's return statement, inside the mapping of `mockNotifications`. It stopped at `<Typography variant="h6" fontWeight="bold">`, which was meant to render the notification title, but lacked the closing tags, the rest of the notification details (message and time), and the divider between notifications.

2. **Completed the Mapping Logic**: I finished the JSX for each notification item by adding:
   - The title rendering: `{notification.title}` inside the Typography.
   - A Typography for the message: `<Typography variant="body1" sx={{ mt: 0.5 }}>{notification.message}</Typography>`.
   - A Typography for the timestamp: `<Typography variant="body2" color="text.secondary" sx={{ mt: 1 }}>{notification.time}</Typography>`.
   - A conditional divider (`<Box sx={{ height: 1, bgcolor: "#e0e0e0" }} />`) to separate notifications, but only if it's not the last item in the list.

   This ensures each notification is displayed as a flex row with an avatar, title, message, and time, matching the style of other pages.

3. **Closed All Open Elements**: I added the closing `</Box>` for the inner flex container, the closing `</Box>` for the padded container around each notification, and then closed the map function's parent `Box` with the divider logic. Finally, I closed the CardContent, Card, motion.div, Container, and Layout components to make the entire NotificationsPage valid and complete.

4. **Maintained Consistency**: 
   - I kept the styling consistent with the rest of the code (e.g., using `#A2D5C6` and `#CFFFE2` for avatars based on notification type, similar to chips in other pages).
   - No new dependencies or features were added; I stuck to the imported components (e.g., Typography, Box, Avatar, Card).
   - The loading state and skeleton were already handled, so I didn't modify those.
   - Animations via Framer Motion and Material-UI elements were preserved.

5. **Output Format**: I wrapped the entire completed code in a JavaScript code block for easy copying and use. The result is a fully functional set of page components that could be integrated into a larger React app (assuming Layout and SkeletonLoading are defined elsewhere).

If this was for a specific project or if you meant something else (e.g., due to the typo in "exaplin"), let me know for further adjustments!
